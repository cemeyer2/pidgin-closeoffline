pidgin-closeoffline
===================

Pidgin plugin to close tabs of buddies that are offline

Build scripts are primitive so far and have only been tested on Ubuntu 12.04.1
32 bit and 64 bit, but should work on most recent Ubuntu editions. Simply run
the 

    install_ubuntu.sh

script, restart your Pidgin client, and the plugin should appear in your plugins
window in Pidgin, ready for use.

To use the plugin, simply right click on a tab in a tabbed conversation window
and select Close offline buddies, which will close all tabs in which your chat
partner has signed offline.
